Namib comes with it's own tools that help you configuring your computer the way you want - without searching for scattered settings across the whole system and looking things up on the internet. Just open the system control panel, open the tool and select what you want.

    Namib maintains it's own program to install, update and remove packages from the system. Just open it, choose what you want and click 'install'. All other needed things will be done automatically and the only thing you need to do is to start the program.
