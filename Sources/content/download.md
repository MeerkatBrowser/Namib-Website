For simplicity we have selected Mate for our flagship editions. If you want to look for other experiences, we created many flavours that focus around other desktops.

For example we have editions that use technology that makes them very resource-efficient and makes them a good choice for *old computers*. Other editions focus on breaking with user interface standards that are decades old and giving users a modern experience. As not everybody wants to have such an experience and likes a more traditional way how everything works, we have editions that focus on this *traditional workflow*.

*IF NOTHING APPEAR, BE SURE YOU SELECTED ONE FLAVOUR*
